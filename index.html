        This is the story of a digital christmas, a download for some, but could
        bring most a smile with the simple sight of a thumb. The devices
        affluter, excited to meet their new friends. That is until those friends
        seemingly host hands of butter, leading their devices ends. Still there
        was hope, that the companion wasn't all dope, with holster on their
        side, getting to tommorow wouldn't be such a slippery slope.

        The day began electrifed, all the bytes fully charged after a restfull
        night's sleep. Only to find, under their box format .jpg's, nothing but
        corruption 'n trojans. Keystroke recorders and malware trick orders, the
        two only things that could now chortle. Still, they could not fear, for
        with their loved ones still near, they could look at the evil and sneer.
        Go, all ye hackers, away from here! You can't steal our happiness, so
        better luck next year!

      Both stories hold triumph and growth from things we often blame our own
      issues in. Hopefully in examination of this tale, we can see how, we, as
      humans, should probably try harder too.
